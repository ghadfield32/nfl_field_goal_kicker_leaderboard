We are pleased to inform you that you've been selected to advance to the next stage of the interview process for the Senior Data Scientist position with the Denver Broncos. The next stage is a technical assessment outlined below. The technical assessment must be completed by Sunday, July 6th at 10:00 PM MT.

 

Upon receiving this email, please notify the Football Technology and Research department (footballresearch.technology@broncos.nfl.net) if you plan to complete the technical assessment or withdraw from consideration for the position as soon as possible. This will help us verify that the automated email from our HR system was delivered to you properly. We will do our best to follow up with candidates who do not respond.

 

Technical Assessment: NFL Field Goal Kicker Leaderboard

 

Overview

At the link below you will find a dataset of NFL field goal attempts from 2010-2018. The dataset includes field goal attempts through week 6 of the 2018 regular season. Implement a statistical model that could be automated to update a leaderboard of kickers each week. 

 

Deliverables

    A `leaderboard.csv` file with data for the kicker leaderboard as of week 6 of the 2018 regular season. The table should include the following columns: `player_id`, `player_name`, `rating`, and `rank`. The `rating` column should be a numeric value generated by your model and the `rank` column should rank the kickers from best to worst in ascending order. The table should have one row for each kicker. It does not need to contain every kicker in the dataset.
    A script (R or Python) used to generate your `leaderboard.csv` file. The script should be well documented and easy to follow (i.e. explain what you are doing). The script can source/import code from other files, but all code must be included. Include explanations for how to interpret the `rating` you defined as well as how you selected/filtered players for the leaderboard. We encourage you to use a notebook interface like R Markdown or Jupyter that includes code, text, and outputs (plots, tables, etc.). If you choose to do so, please render the document as HTML or PDF. Code and code outputs that are not rendered in a readable format may not be considered in the review of your assessment.
    A short critique of your work summarized in a PDF, .txt file, .md file, or MS Word document. Consider the following:
        How could your work be improved?
        Given more time, what would your next steps be?
        Are there any models/techniques/areas you are unfamiliar with that might improve your work? Any new/foreign methods worth researching?

 

Considerations

    Do not source or include any additional data. Limit your analysis to the files included at the link below. The files are intentionally sparse and additional factors (weather, game context, team strength, etc.) are not the focus of the assessment.
    Design your kicker rating/leaderboard to answer hypothetical questions from decision-makers like "Which kicker do you like better: Kicker A or Kicker B?" or "Who are the Top 5 kickers in the NFL right now?".
    Your model does not need to match the model you outlined in your application, but we would appreciate an explanation of any discrepancies or design changes.
