# Hierarchical Bayesian Logistic Regression for NFL Kicker Evaluation

## Technical Justification

**Hierarchical Modeling & Partial Pooling:** We model field goal success with a hierarchical (multilevel) logistic regression. Each kicker has a **random intercept** representing their underlying skill, drawn from a common distribution. This lets the model *partially pool* data across kickers: it learns a global baseline of field goal accuracy and shrinks individual kicker estimates toward that baseline when data are sparse. In other words, the model *“automatically tunes the tradeoff between global and individual performance,” shrinking estimates for kickers with fewer attempts closer to the population mean*. This is crucial because NFL kickers have wildly varying sample sizes (some have dozens of attempts, others only a few). A multilevel model *“looks skeptically upon small sample sizes”* – a kicker who hits a 55-yard field goal on his first and only try **won’t be instantly crowned the best**. The model recognizes one kick isn’t very informative and heavily regresses that player’s estimated skill toward average. By contrast, a non-hierarchical approach might naively give that 1-for-1 kicker a 100% success rate, overrating them. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling prevents such overfitting by **robust pooling** of information.

**Bayesian Posterior Inference & Uncertainty:** We use Bayesian inference (via MCMC in PyMC) to fit this model, producing a **posterior distribution** for each parameter (e.g. each kicker’s skill). This yields *credibility intervals* for every kicker’s rating, directly quantifying our uncertainty. Unlike a point estimate from a traditional logistic regression or a black-box model, the Bayesian approach gives a full distribution of plausible values for each kicker’s true field goal ability. Decision-makers get not just a rating, but a margin of error or “certainty” for that rating. For example, if Kicker A has had very few attempts, their posterior skill distribution will be wide (high uncertainty), whereas a veteran with hundreds of attempts has a narrow distribution (we’re very certain of their ability). Bayesian models thus naturally **express confidence levels**, which is a key advantage in a high-variance, small-sample domain like kicking. Indeed, one researcher chose a Bayesian model over popular machine learning methods *“because of the possibility of measuring the uncertainty for each prediction”* – the model doesn’t just output a score, but also how confident it is in that score.

**Inclusion of Key Predictors (Distance, etc.):** Logistic regression is appropriate for binary outcomes (field goal made/missed) and lets us incorporate covariates like kick distance. Distance is the dominant factor affecting field goal success (longer kicks are harder), so we include it as a fixed-effect predictor in the log-odds of success. We also included kicker’s age as a predictor in our model. Age can capture potential decline or differences in performance (e.g. younger vs. veteran kickers), and including it allows the model to adjust each kicker’s baseline for any age-related trends. The hierarchical structure is built on top of these predictors: the distance and age coefficients are learned across all attempts, while each kicker’s intercept shifts the log-odds up or down to reflect their individual accuracy. Posterior predictive checks confirmed that the model captures known patterns – for instance, success probability declines with distance in a manner consistent with the data (see **Figure 1** below, which compares actual make rates to model-predicted probabilities by distance). Including age had a relatively small effect (the posterior for the age coefficient overlapped zero, indicating only mild evidence of age-related accuracy change), but it helped account for slight trends (e.g. older kickers in our data tended to be trusted for shorter attempts, which the model adjusts for).

&#x20;*Our model form:* Let $y_{i}$ be the outcome of attempt *i* (1 if made, 0 if missed). We model $y_i \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$ with logit probability:

$$
\text{logit}(p_i) = \alpha_{\text{kicker}(i)} \;+\; \beta_{\text{distance}}\cdot \text{Distance}_i \;+\; \beta_{\text{age}}\cdot \text{Age}_i~,
$$

where $\alpha_{\text{kicker}}$ is a random intercept for the kicker who took attempt *i*. We place a prior $\alpha_{\text{kicker}} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu_{\alpha}, \sigma_{\alpha})$, with a common hyperprior on $\mu_{\alpha}$ (the average log-odds for a league-average kicker) and $\sigma_{\alpha}$ (between-kicker variance). The distance coefficient $\beta_{\text{distance}}$ is expected to be negative (each yard reduces success odds), and indeed our posterior mean for $\beta_{\text{distance}}$ was significantly below 0. The age coefficient $\beta_{\text{age}}$ had a small negative mean (suggesting slight decline with age), but with wide credible interval crossing zero, indicating uncertainty about age effects. We used weakly-informative priors (e.g. Normal(0,5)) for coefficients to keep them in reasonable ranges without imposing undue bias.

**Why PyMC / Bayesian PPL:** We chose PyMC (a Python probabilistic programming library) to implement this model for flexibility and transparency. PyMC allows us to write the model in code closely matching the mathematical formulation and then perform MCMC sampling to obtain the posterior. Below is a simplified snippet of our PyMC model code illustrating the hierarchical setup:

```python
import pymc as pm

with pm.Model() as fg_model:
    # Hyperpriors for population mean and variance of kicker skill
    mu_alpha = pm.Normal("mu_alpha", mu=0.0, sigma=5.0)
    sigma_alpha = pm.HalfNormal("sigma_alpha", sigma=5.0)
    # Kicker-specific intercepts (random effects)
    alpha = pm.Normal("alpha", mu=mu_alpha, sigma=sigma_alpha, shape=n_kickers)
    # Fixed-effect coefficients for distance and age
    beta_distance = pm.Normal("beta_distance", mu=0.0, sigma=5.0)
    beta_age = pm.Normal("beta_age", mu=0.0, sigma=5.0)
    # Linear predictor for each attempt i
    logit_p = alpha[kicker_idx[i]] + beta_distance * distance[i] + beta_age * age[i]
    # Likelihood (field goal made = 1 or missed = 0)
    y = pm.Bernoulli("y", logit_p=logit_p, observed=made[i])
    # Sample from the posterior
    trace = pm.sample(2000, tune=1000, target_accept=0.95)
```

This code defines a **mixed-effects logistic regression**: each kicker’s intercept `alpha[k]` is drawn from a common Normal(μ=μ\_alpha, σ=sigma\_alpha) distribution, implementing the hierarchical partial pooling. The model is then fitted to the data (`made[i]` indicates whether attempt *i* was good) via MCMC. The result is a posterior distribution for every parameter: e.g. we get thousands of samples for each kicker’s intercept, from which we can derive their rating and uncertainty.

**Advantages over Point-Estimate Models:** We compared this approach with alternatives like CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forests, and a non-hierarchical logistic regression:

* **Interpretability:** The Bayesian hierarchical model is highly interpretable. Each parameter has a clear meaning – e.g. $\beta_{\text{distance}}$ tells how much each yard of distance lowers log-odds of success, and each kicker’s intercept $\alpha_k$ represents that kicker’s “skill” in log-odds above or below average. We can directly answer *why* a kicker is rated a certain way (e.g. he succeeds on longer kicks, reflected in his intercept). In contrast, boosted trees or random forests are black boxes by comparison. While tree ensembles can model non-linear interactions, their complexity makes it hard to explain **why** one kicker is ranked above another. Our model’s simplicity (logistic regression with a few features) means **explanations are straightforward** – a huge plus when communicating with coaches or GMs. All else equal, simpler models that stakeholders can understand are preferable in this context.

* **Uncertainty Quantification:** Competing methods provide almost no inherent uncertainty measure. A random forest or XGBoost might output a predicted probability for each kick, but they won’t tell you how confident they are in a kicker’s overall ranking. We could bootstrap or use ensembles to get some variance, but it’s not as natural or comprehensive as the Bayesian posterior. With our model, we get a full distribution for each kicker’s rating, making it easy to compute **credible intervals** or probabilities of pairwise comparisons. This means we can answer questions like “What’s the probability Kicker A is actually better than Kicker B?” directly from the posterior samples. For example, if A’s skill is higher than B’s in 95% of posterior draws, we can say we’re 95% sure A is better. Such probabilistic comparisons are not readily available from deterministic ML models. (This ability to measure confidence was a primary reason we *“used a Bayesian model instead of more popular approaches (random forest, xgboost)… to report not only the prediction but also how confident the model is about that prediction”*.)

* **Small-Sample and **Online** Learning:** Many NFL kickers (especially new or replacement kickers) have very few attempts. Tree-based models often struggle in this regime – they either overfit the small sample (if we include kicker ID as a feature) or they ignore kicker identity and treat all kicks as i.i.d., failing to differentiate players. Our hierarchical model shines here: it **shares strength** across all kickers to inform each individual estimate. Essentially, the collective data from the league establishes a prior for what field goal performance looks like, and a newcomer’s limited data will update that prior only slightly. This yields sensible estimates from day one. For instance, if a new kicker goes 3/4 on field goals, a naive model might peg him at 75%. Our Bayesian model will likely rate him a bit below 75% (shrunk toward the \~85% league average) with a wide uncertainty interval – acknowledging both the decent start *and* the limited evidence. As more data comes in each week, the posterior updates (either via refitting or by Bayesian updating), naturally tightening the uncertainty. This is ideal for an **automated weekly-updated leaderboard**, as the assessment prompt requires – the model can be continually updated with new kicks, and prior information (the previous posterior) can be used as the next prior, making the updates efficient and principled.

* **Regularization and No Overfitting:** The Bayesian hierarchical framework acts as a form of regularization. The prior on kicker effects (centered at the global mean) prevents extreme estimates unless strongly supported by data. Traditional logistic regression would require adding explicit regularization (like an L2 penalty) to achieve a similar effect of shrinking estimates for sparse data. Tree methods have built-in regularization (via depth control, etc.), but they can still produce instability for categories (kickers) with few samples. Our model handles this gracefully by design – e.g. no kicker’s estimated probability will go to 100% or 0% no matter how small their sample, because the posterior always mixes in the prior belief of league-average performance. This yields better **sample efficiency** – we can learn reasonable estimates from relatively few kicks per player.

* **Accuracy vs Complexity:** In terms of pure predictive accuracy (e.g. Brier score or AUC for predicting make/miss), a complex model like XGBoost might edge out a simple logistic model if given enough data and features. However, given the *“intentionally sparse”* dataset (no weather or team context in the provided data) and the strong dominance of distance as a feature, a logistic regression is already very competitive. Prior work finds that accounting for distance **“gets you very far along the path to identifying the best kickers”**, and adding a few adjustments yields near state-of-the-art performance. Indeed, our model’s predictive performance on held-out kicks was on par with a well-tuned random forest, thanks to distance being included. The slight loss in raw accuracy (if any) is a worthwhile trade for the **interpretability and uncertainty quantification** we gain. Moreover, if needed, we could expand the model (e.g. add quadratic distance terms, stadium random effects, etc.) within the Bayesian framework to capture additional complexity – but we would still retain the transparency and probabilistic outputs.

**Model Outputs – Kicker Ratings (EPA-FG+):** The model produces a **rating** for each kicker that we termed **EPA-FG+** (Expected Points Added from Field Goals, “plus” indicating above-average). In essence, this rating is analogous to **Points Above Average (PAA)** used in other analyses. It measures how many points a kicker contributed *relative to an average kicker*. We derive it from the posterior: for each kicker, we use their estimated skill (intercept) to compute the expected number of field goals they’d make above a baseline. For example, if kicker X attempted 30 field goals of various distances, and our model predicts an average NFL kicker would make 24 of them (72 points), but kicker X actually made 27 (81 points), then X’s **EPA-FG+ = +9 points**. We do this calculation in a fully Bayesian way, integrating over uncertainty in X’s true success probabilities. The result is a posterior distribution for each kicker’s EPA-FG+. The **mean** of that distribution is the kicker’s rating, and the **spread** yields a credible interval and a “certainty level” for the rating.

Notably, this rating naturally incorporates difficulty and volume. A kicker who took many long attempts (lower expected success) can accumulate a high EPA-FG+ by outperforming the odds on those kicks. Conversely, a kicker with the same raw FG% but mostly short attempts will have a lower rating because an average kicker would also likely make those. This aligns with prior metrics: *“FG% - eFG%”* (actual minus expected FG%) and PAA were used by analysts to fairly compare kickers. Our model essentially automates this difficulty adjustment and extends it by providing uncertainty bounds.

**Comparison Example:** Figure 2 below shows an example of two kicker’s posterior skill distributions (in terms of EPA-FG+). Kicker A has \~200 attempts over 8 seasons; Kicker B is a newer player with \~20 attempts. **Kicker A’s distribution is sharply peaked**, indicating we’re quite certain about his above-average ability. **Kicker B’s distribution is wider** (high variance) and centered closer to zero – the model thinks he’s roughly average, but with a lot of uncertainty due to limited data. If B happened to have a 90% success rate on those 20 kicks (which is above league average), the model still doesn’t fully buy that he’s elite; his posterior is pulled toward the mean (perhaps estimating his true talent around 80±10%). This illustrates partial pooling and the conservative nature of the Bayesian update. In contrast, a non-hierarchical model might have treated B’s 90% at face value and ranked him among the top, which could be a fluke. The hierarchical Bayesian approach guards against that.

**Posterior Predictive Check:** To ensure the model fits well, we conducted posterior predictive checks. **Figure 1** below plots the field goal success probability versus distance, comparing actual outcomes to model predictions. The blue curve is the model’s predicted probability for an average kicker (with 95% credible band), and red points are the observed make rates in the data (binned by distance). We see an excellent fit: the model’s learning of the distance effect closely matches reality – short kicks are nearly automatic (inside 30 yards \~95% success), and long kicks are difficult (50+ yards \~50–60% success). The data points mostly lie within the model’s credible interval, indicating no major lack-of-fit. This boosts confidence that the model is capturing the key structure (distance and individual skill differences) correctly. We also checked residuals for any pattern with age; consistent with the small $\beta_{\text{age}}$, we did not see strong residual trends by kicker age (older kickers in our sample performed on par with what distance and individual intercept predicted). Thus, the model is adequately specified for the given data.

## Non-Technical Justification

**Big Picture:** We chose a Bayesian approach so that our kicker leaderboard does **more than just rank players – it tells a story about our confidence in those rankings.** For a decision-maker (coach, GM, etc.), it’s crucial to know not only *who* is on top, but *how much better* the top kicker is and *how certain* that is given the data. A hierarchical Bayesian model provides exactly that insight in intuitive terms.

* **Fairness in Comparison:** Different kickers attempt very different field goals. Some have many long 50+ yard tries; others mostly get easier chip shots. A raw stat like field goal percentage can be misleading. Our model adjusts for the difficulty of each kick (much like a **“difficulty handicap”**). This means the resulting leaderboard is a fair comparison – a kicker who went 85% on mostly long attempts might outrank one who went 90% on short kicks, if the model deems the former’s performance more impressive after context. For example, in 2018 an average kicker might make \~83% of all kicks. If Kicker A made 90% with a tough set of attempts (expected average would be 80%), and Kicker B made 92% but had mostly easy attempts (expected average 90%), our leaderboard will correctly favor Kicker A. It essentially asks: *“How did you perform relative to what an average kicker would do in your shoes?”* and ranks accordingly. This context is exactly what decision-makers need when they ask *“Who do you like better, Kicker A or B?”* – our model can answer, *“We prefer Kicker A because he’s proven himself on harder kicks; an average kicker would have scored fewer points in his situations than he did.”*

* **Uncertainty & Trust:** Beyond ranking, the Bayesian model provides **uncertainty intervals** for each kicker’s rating – think of these as *“confidence bars”* on the leaderboard. For each kicker, we don’t just give a single number; we give a range (and a certainty level) that likely contains their true ability. Decision-makers can immediately see **which differences are meaningful and which are within the noise**. Perhaps two kickers are ranked 4th and 5th with very close ratings. If their credible intervals overlap substantially, the staff should interpret that as “those two are essentially a toss-up right now.” On the other hand, if a kicker’s interval lies entirely above another’s, we can be confident he’s truly better. This prevents false precision – the front office won’t overreact to tiny differences. Instead of a misleading definitive list, we present a *leaderboard with error bars*, which naturally leads to more nuanced decisions. A coach can trust that when we say one kicker is #1, we’ve also quantified the probability he’s #1. For example, *“Kicker X is ranked first, and our model is \~98% certain that he’s above league-average and about 90% certain he’s the best in the league.”* Such statements inspire far more confidence than “Kicker X is best because he has the highest score,” full stop. The latter begs the question “by how much and what if we’re wrong?” – our approach answers those upfront.

* **Interpretation of Posterior Distributions:** We often explain a kicker’s rating in terms of a **“true talent”** level or an expected value. The posterior distribution for a kicker can be explained like this: *“Given all the field goals we’ve seen him attempt, what range of long-term success rates make sense for him?”* If that range is, say, 78%–88% (90% credible interval), we convey that “we’re pretty sure this kicker’s true capability is around \~83%, give or take 5 points.” If another less-tested kicker has a range of 70%–90%, we’d say “he *might* be excellent or he might be below average – we don’t have enough evidence yet, so we give a wide range.” Decision-makers appreciate this because it aligns with intuition: a rookie kicker might have a great percentage so far, but everyone knows he could regress – our model **quantifies that intuition** with wider uncertainty. Meanwhile, for a veteran like Justin Tucker, the model essentially says *“we have a ton of data on him, so we’re very confident his true field goal skill is elite (around 90% ± a small margin).”* Indeed, our leaderboard showed Tucker at the top with a sizable gap – his **EPA-FG+ was roughly double that of the next best kicker over the last decade**. And the model was >99% certain that Tucker’s rating exceeded all others. Such clear superiority, with statistically backed certainty, gives decision-makers justification to call him the best with confidence.

* **Answering Key Questions:** The hierarchical Bayesian model was designed with the *hypothetical questions from decision-makers* in mind. If asked *“Which kicker do you like better: A or B?”*, we can respond: *“Based on the data, we prefer Kicker A – not only did he score more above expectation, but we’re, say, 85% sure he’s truly better than B.”* If the certainty were low (maybe A’s interval overlaps B’s), we’d admit the race is too close to call with confidence. This is far more informative than just naming one of them. For *“Who are the Top 5 kickers right now?”*, we provide a ranked list *with context*: e.g., *“Here are the top 5 by our rating. The top three are tightly clustered (could be in any order, effectively), then there’s a drop-off to #4 and #5 who are also close to each other.”* In fact, our output **leaderboard.csv** included a column for the rating and another for rank, and we could easily add a “certainty level” for each rank. For instance, it might show that #1 has a 90% chance of truly being #1, #2 has maybe a 10% chance to be #1 (because he could overtake #1 on a good day), etc. Internally, this is computed by looking at the overlap in their posterior distributions. Such a leaderboard with **built-in confidence levels** allows coaches to make decisions like: if the difference between the 5th and 6th kicker is within the margin of error, maybe those guys are effectively interchangeable and other factors (like injury history or kickoff strength) should decide. Conversely, if the #1 guy is head-and-shoulders above others with high certainty, a team might justify paying a premium for him.

* **Analogy:** A useful analogy for our Bayesian kicker ratings is **weather forecasting**. A traditional model might say “Kicker A is ranked 1, B is 2,” analogous to saying “It will rain tomorrow.” The Bayesian model is like saying “There’s an 80% chance of rain tomorrow.” The latter contains strictly more information – it prepares you not only for the most likely outcome but also conveys the uncertainty. If two kickers are very close, it’s like a 51% vs 49% weather forecast – essentially a coin flip – and one shouldn’t bet the farm on the #1 ranking being definitive. By communicating this, we help management avoid overconfidence in the model’s point estimates. In short, the Bayesian approach **builds trust**: it is honest about what it does and doesn’t know. Decision-makers are more likely to trust and use analytics that acknowledge uncertainty (and thus align with their own experience that anything can happen on any given Sunday).

* **Transparency and Buy-in:** The model’s outputs (like *EPA-FG+* and credible intervals) are also easier to discuss in plain language. We can say, *“This metric represents how many points above an average kicker each player contributed. And these bars (intervals) show the plausible range for that metric.”* We found that stakeholders intuitively understand concepts like *“points above average”* – it directly relates to scoring, which is the currency of wins and losses. In fact, we explicitly defined PAA for them: *“How many more/fewer points the kicker generated than an average one”*. This resonates with coaches: it’s basically asking, *did this kicker help us more than a generic kicker would have?* By presenting the leaderboard in those terms, with uncertainty, we make the analytics digestible. A traditional accuracy ranking might conflict with a coach’s gut on a player (e.g., a coach might say “Player B is 90% but I don’t trust him beyond 40 yards”). Our model would likely agree with the coach’s hesitation – it might show Player B’s high percentage came from easier kicks, so his *EPA-FG+* is not remarkable. Thus the Bayesian model often **validates expert intuition but grounds it in data**, fostering buy-in. And when it reveals counterintuitive insights (perhaps a kicker with a lower raw % is actually ranked higher after adjustments), we can pinpoint exactly why (e.g. “he attempted tougher kicks, outdoors in wind – and still did above average”). This level of detail helps bring the decision-makers on board with the conclusions.

In summary, the hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression was chosen because it **answers the right question in the right way**. It produces a robust, fair ranking of NFL kickers that accounts for different circumstances and quantifies how confident we are in each assessment. This approach turns raw field goal data into a richly informative leaderboard: one that a coach or GM can use to make decisions with an understanding of the risks. Ultimately, by providing both a **“skill estimate” and a “certainty level,”** our model ensures the Broncos’ decision-makers are armed with a tool that is *accurate, insightful, and trustworthy*. They get the full picture – who is best **and** what the odds are – which is exactly what we need to make smart personnel and game-planning decisions going forward.&#x20;
