Bayesian hierarchical modeling brings several crucial advantages to the kicker‐rating problem, especially when we need robust, interpretable estimates of each kicker’s true ability from uneven and sometimes sparse data. Below is a step-by-step walkthrough of **why** we choose a Bayesian approach here and **how** it’s actually put to work in the field-goal model.

---

## 1. Why Bayesian? Key Benefits

1. **Partial pooling (shrinkage)**

   * **Problem:** Some kickers have very few attempts (e.g. a rookie going 5-for-5), which makes raw percentages wildly over- or understate their skill.
   * **Bayesian fix:** By modeling each kicker’s intercept and slope as drawn from a common distribution, we “shrink” extreme individual estimates toward the league average when data are scarce. This avoids absurd curves like “100% success at all distances” for a small sample.

2. **Uncertainty quantification**

   * **Problem:** A single number (e.g. 90% make rate) hides how confident we really are—did the kicker have hundreds of attempts or only a handful?
   * **Bayesian fix:** We obtain full posterior distributions for each kicker’s parameters (and derived metrics like EPA-FG+), so we can report credible intervals (e.g. “Kicker A’s EPA-FG+ is +0.20 ± 0.10, 95% CI”) instead of just a point estimate.

3. **Natural regularization via priors**

   * **Problem:** Overfitting can plague high-dimensional mixed models, especially with limited data.
   * **Bayesian fix:** We place weakly informative priors on population-level effects and on the hyperparameters (the standard deviations of the kicker–level effects), which automatically regularizes extreme parameter values without manual penalty tuning.

4. **Full probabilistic predictions**

   * **Problem:** Downstream metrics (like Expected Points Added per attempt) require integrating over uncertainty—not just plugging in a single best–fit parameter set.
   * **Bayesian fix:** Because we have samples from the joint posterior, we can simulate success probabilities at each distance many times and propagate uncertainty through to our final EPA-FG+ estimates.

---

## 2. How It’s Used: From Data to Leaderboard

1. **Model specification**

   * **Likelihood:** Each kick is a Bernoulli trial (made = 1 or missed = 0).
   * **Linear predictor:**

     $$
       \text{logit}(p_{ij}) = \alpha + \beta \,\times\, \text{distance}_i \;+\; u_j \;+\; v_j \,\times\, \text{distance}_i
     $$

     where

     * $\alpha,\beta$ are population-level intercept and distance slope,
     * $u_j,v_j$ are kicker *j*’s intercept and slope deviations.

2. **Priors and hyperpriors**

   ```python
   α ∼ Normal(0, 5)  
   β ∼ Normal(0, 2)  
   σ_u ∼ HalfNormal(1)  
   σ_v ∼ HalfNormal(1)  
   u_j ∼ Normal(0, σ_u)  
   v_j ∼ Normal(0, σ_v)
   ```

   These priors encode “we expect most kickers to cluster around the league average, with only a bit of spread.”

3. **Posterior inference**

   * We feed data (distance, outcome, kicker ID) into a sampler (e.g. MCMC via PyMC).
   * The output is a large collection of joint samples $\{\alpha, \beta, \sigma_u, \sigma_v, u_j, v_j\}$ that reflect both data likelihood and prior beliefs.

4. **Generating individual curves**

   * For each posterior sample and each kicker *j*, compute

     $$
       p_j(\text{dist}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\alpha + u_j + (\beta + v_j)\,\text{dist})}}.
     $$
   * Aggregating these across samples yields mean curves plus credible bands.

5. **Simulating EPA-FG+**

   * Draw a large set of “typical” distances from the empirical distribution of NFL attempts (e.g. weighted toward 30–45 yards).
   * For each posterior draw and kicker *j*, compute expected points $=3\times p_j(\text{dist})$ and average over the simulated distances.
   * Subtract the league-average over those same distances to get **EPA-FG+**, with full uncertainty intervals.

---

## 3. Intuition and Business Value

* **Fair comparisons:** Shrinkage prevents over-rewarding or over-penalizing kickers with few attempts.
* **Actionable uncertainty:** Coaches can see not only “Kicker A is rated +0.20” but also “I’m only 80% confident it’s above zero,” which informs roster and in-game decisions.
* **Extendability:** Want to add weather, altitude, or pressure variables? Just include them as additional predictors, and the same Bayesian machinery will calibrate their effects.
* **Automation:** As new weeks of data arrive, you refit (or update) the posterior and regenerate the leaderboard every Monday morning—fully reproducible and auditable.

---

### In summary

Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression gives us **robust**, **interpretable**, and **uncertainty-aware** kicker ratings that gracefully handle the uneven, sparse nature of field-goal data. By pooling across the league while still estimating individual skill curves, it delivers a fair, data-driven foundation for everything from weekly roster decisions to long-term scouting.

## Summary

To rigorously benchmark your hierarchical Bayesian kicker‐rating model against alternatives, you can evaluate **discrimination**, **calibration**, **threshold‐based**, and **Bayesian‐specific** criteria. Discrimination metrics like AUC-ROC and AUC-PR quantify how well the model ranks made vs. missed kicks; calibration/proper scoring rules such as log loss and Brier score assess the quality of the predicted probabilities; threshold‐based metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F₁) evaluate decision‐rule performance; and Bayesian model comparison tools (WAIC, PSIS-LOO) along with posterior predictive checks gauge out-of-sample predictive fit and model adequacy under uncertainty. Below is a structured overview of these metrics and when to use them.

---

## Standard Classification Metrics

### Discrimination

* **Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)** measures the model’s ability to rank positive (made) vs. negative (missed) outcomes across all thresholds ([scikit-learn.org][1], [stats.stackexchange.com][2]).
* **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR)** is especially informative under class imbalance, summarizing the tradeoff between precision and recall over thresholds ([scikit-learn.org][3]).

### Calibration & Proper Scoring Rules

* **Log Loss (Cross-Entropy)** penalizes over-confident incorrect probability estimates; lower values indicate better calibrated predictions ([scikit-learn.org][1], [jmlr.org][4]).
* **Brier Score** is the mean squared error between predicted probabilities and actual outcomes (0/1), decomposable into calibration and refinement components ([scikit-learn.org][1], [en.wikipedia.org][5]).
* **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)** quantifies the average gap between predicted probability bins and observed frequencies, highlighting systematic bias in probability estimates ([medium.com][6]).
* **Calibration Curve (Reliability Diagram)** visually compares predicted vs. observed event rates across probability bins ([scikit-learn.org][1]).

### Threshold-Based Metrics

While probabilistic metrics focus on scores, thresholded decisions at a chosen cutoff can be assessed with:

* **Accuracy**: proportion of correct binary predictions ([stats.stackexchange.com][2]).
* **Precision** (Positive Predictive Value): TP/(TP + FP), the fraction of predicted “made” that were correct ([scikit-learn.org][7]).
* **Recall** (Sensitivity): TP/(TP + FN), the fraction of actual “made” that were identified ([scikit-learn.org][7]).
* **F₁ Score**: harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing false positives and negatives ([scikit-learn.org][1]).

---

## Bayesian Model Comparison Metrics

### Information Criteria

* **WAIC (Watanabe–Akaike Information Criterion)** estimates out-of-sample predictive accuracy using the log-pointwise posterior predictive density, with an effective‐parameter penalty for complexity ([pymc.io][8]).
* **PSIS-LOO (Pareto-Smoothed Importance Sampling Leave-One-Out CV)** provides efficient approximate LOO cross-validation, often more robust in finite samples than WAIC ([mc-stan.org][9], [sites.stat.columbia.edu][10]).
* **DIC (Deviance Information Criterion)** is an older Bayesian IC based on deviance and effective parameters but tends to overfit and is less invariant than WAIC/LOO ([en.wikipedia.org][11], [jmlr.org][4]).

These criteria allow comparing hierarchical Bayesian models and alternatives (e.g., regularized logistic regression) on a common predictive‐accuracy scale.

### Posterior Predictive Checks

* **Posterior Predictive Checks (PPCs)** assess whether replicated data generated under the fitted model resemble actual observations (means, variances, quantiles). Discrepancies highlight model misfit ([mc-stan.org][12], [stats.stackexchange.com][13]).
* **Population Predictive Checks** extend PPCs to held-out or external data, avoiding “double‐use” of data for estimation and evaluation ([mc-stan.org][12], [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov][14]).

By plotting simulated vs. observed kick‐distance success rates or other summaries, you can visually and quantitatively diagnose model shortcomings.

---

## Putting It All Together

A robust evaluation protocol might proceed as follows:

1. **Compute discrimination and calibration metrics** (AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, log loss, Brier score) on a held-out test set to compare Bayesian and non-Bayesian models under the same splits ([scikit-learn.org][1]).
2. **Thresholded performance**: report accuracy, precision, recall, F₁ at operational cutoffs relevant to coaching decisions (e.g., probability > 0.5) ([stats.stackexchange.com][2]).
3. **Information criteria**: use WAIC and PSIS-LOO to compare models on full data likelihood, accounting for complexity, especially when refitting each week with all available data ([pymc.io][8], [mc-stan.org][9]).
4. **Posterior predictive assessment**: simulate new kick outcomes under each model and compare summary statistics (e.g., overall success rates by distance bins) to observed data to detect mis-calibration or missing structure ([mc-stan.org][12], [numberanalytics.com][15]).

By triangulating across these metrics, you ensure your kicker‐rating model is not only discriminative but also well calibrated, adequately penalized for complexity, and faithful to the empirical patterns in the data—ultimately yielding more trustworthy and actionable ratings.

6. Interpreting parameters

    β ≈ –0.10 to –0.11 per yard: about a 9–10% drop in make probability every 5 yards — consistent with known NFL kicking trends.

    σᵤ (intercept variability) is small: kickers are similar on short kicks.

    σᵥ (slope variability) is larger: indicates leg strength differences at long range.


7. Estimating kicker curves

    Each kicker’s success curve:
    logit(pj(d))=(α+uj)+(β+vj)⋅d
    logit(pj​(d))=(α+uj​)+(β+vj​)⋅d

    Justin Tucker’s curve (flatter decay) vs. a weaker kicker (steeper decay) highlights kick-specific deviations, demonstrating effective partial pooling

8. Shrinkage in Bayesian estimation

    For kickers with few attempts, parameters naturally shrink toward the population mean, avoiding overconfidence on limited data — a key benefit of hierarchical modeling


9. Validating model performance

    You check calibration using held-out data and metrics like Brier score, showing that the hierarchical model generalizes better than non-pooling alternatives.



10. Computing EPA‑FG+ (Expected Points Added)

    Sample distances from the empirical league distribution $F(d)$.

    For each kicker, compute mean success probability across $F(d)$.

    Multiply by 3 (points per FG) to get expected points per attempt.

    Subtract league-average (~2.53) to produce EPA‑FG+, which quantifies point value over league average.


11. Leaderboard & uncertainty

    You rank kickers by posterior EPA‑FG+ and show credible intervals.

    E.g., rookies (Sanders, Maher) are high but uncertain, while vets like Tucker have tighter intervals.




12. Critique & future enhancements

    Add predictors: weather, stadium, knots, game pressure, time-varying ability.

    Model selection bias of coached attempts via a decision model.

    Consider non-linear distance effects (quadratic, splines) for better tail behavior.

    Introduce time‑varying performance via state‑space or dynamic models.



🔍 Summary of why this is the best approach for your idea

    Hierarchical structure balances individual fit & league-wide insight with shrinkage.

    Bayesian framework provides full posterior and uncertainty quantification.

    Distance as primary variable captures key predictive factor while allowing easy extension.

    EPA‑FG+ is intuitive, actionable, and easy to communicate.

    Reproducible and automatable, fitting your deliverable requirements.
    



In Bayesian modeling, we rely on **Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** to approximate complex posterior distributions by constructing a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution matches the target posterior—a process that transforms intractable integrals into manageable sampling problems ([en.wikipedia.org][1], [en.wikipedia.org][2]). To evaluate the quality of probabilistic predictions, the **Brier score** serves as a strictly proper scoring rule equivalent to mean squared error on forecast probabilities, with lower values indicating better calibration and overall accuracy ([en.wikipedia.org][3], [neptune.ai][4]). Finally, **EPA-FG+** (Expected Points Added per Field Goal Attempt) delivers an intuitive, points-above-average metric by simulating each kicker’s success probabilities across the league’s empirical distance mix and comparing to the league baseline ([bestballstats.com][5], [scoutingacademy.com][6]).

## Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

### What Is MCMC?

Markov chain Monte Carlo is a family of algorithms for drawing samples from a target probability distribution by simulating a Markov chain whose stationary distribution equals that target distribution ([en.wikipedia.org][1]).
These methods use random proposals (e.g., Metropolis-Hastings) or gradient-informed moves (e.g., Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) to explore high-dimensional spaces where direct sampling is impossible ([en.wikipedia.org][7]).

### Why Use MCMC for Bayesian Sampling?

Bayesian inference requires computing expectations (integrals) with respect to the posterior, which often lacks a closed-form expression ([reddit.com][8]).
MCMC transforms this problem into Monte Carlo estimation: once a representative sample from the posterior is obtained, we approximate means, variances, and credible intervals by simple averages over the sampled draws ([en.wikipedia.org][2]).
Unlike naïve Monte Carlo, MCMC handles multivariate posteriors of arbitrary shape, enabling Bayesian analysis of complex hierarchical models like our kicker-specific logistic regression.

---

## Brier Score

### Definition and Interpretation

The Brier score measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions by computing the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and actual binary outcomes ([en.wikipedia.org][3]).
Mathematically, for predictions $p_i$ and outcomes $y_i\in\{0,1\}$:

$$
\text{Brier} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N (p_i - y_i)^2.
$$

As a **strictly proper scoring rule**, it rewards both **calibration** (probabilities matching observed frequencies) and **refinement** (assigning extreme probabilities when appropriate) ([neptune.ai][4]).

### Comparing Models with Brier Score

When evaluating multiple classifiers on the same dataset, a **lower Brier score** indicates that a model’s probability estimates are, on average, closer to the true outcomes ([dratings.com][9]).
It is particularly useful for `ROC`-insensitive comparisons—two models with equal accuracy may have very different calibration, which the Brier score will detect.
However, caution is advised when comparing models with different class balance or when models optimize different objectives; Brier score is best used alongside other metrics and on the same test set ([stats.stackexchange.com][10]).

---

## EPA-FG+ (Expected Points Added per Field Goal Attempt)

### What Is EPA-FG+?

EPA-FG+ quantifies a kicker’s value **in points per attempt** relative to the league average by accounting for the difficulty of each field-goal distance ([bestballstats.com][5]).
Concretely, it measures how many extra (or fewer) points a kicker would score if they faced the **same mix of distances** as the average NFL kicker.

### Step-by-Step Computation

1. **Model Success Probabilities**

   * Fit the hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression to estimate $p_j(d)$, the **probability** kicker $j$ makes a field goal from distance $d$ ([statsbylopez.com][11]).
2. **Define Distance Distribution**

   * Use the **empirical distribution** $F(d)$ of field-goal distances (e.g., 2010–2018 data) to represent a realistic mix of attempts.
3. **Simulate Expected Points**

   * Draw a large sample of distances $\{d_i\}$ from $F(d)$.
   * For each sample, compute **expected points** = $3 \times p_j(d_i)$ (since a make yields 3 points).
4. **Compute League Baseline**

   * Repeat step 3 using the **population-level** curve $p_{\text{avg}}(d)$ to get the league’s expected points per attempt.
5. **Calculate EPA-FG+**

   $$
   \text{EPA-FG+}_j \;=\; \underbrace{\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M 3\,p_j(d_i)}_{\text{Kicker }j\text{’s mean points}} 
    \;-\; 
   \underbrace{\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^M 3\,p_{\text{avg}}(d_i)}_{\text{League mean points}}.
   $$
6. **Interpretation**

   * A positive EPA-FG+ means the kicker **adds points** above league average per attempt; a negative value means they **cost points** relative to an average kicker.
   * Over a season, EPA-FG+ × (number of attempts) approximates the total points added or lost relative to average.

---

**In summary**, MCMC provides the flexible sampling engine needed for our hierarchical model, the Brier score offers a rigorous calibration-sensitive metric for evaluating probabilistic forecasts, and EPA-FG+ translates complex posterior outputs into an intuitive “points above average” scale for kicker comparison. Let me know if you’d like deeper dives into MCMC diagnostics, Brier-score breakdowns, or code examples for EPA-FG+ simulation!
